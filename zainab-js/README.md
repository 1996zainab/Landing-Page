-   In CSS Style changes were made to the project to be responsive to all types of screens.

-  There are 4 sections added to the HTML file.

-  There are a lot of things being done on app.js :

 1. Use goToSection() method to scroll to anchor ID using scrollIntoView event.

 2. Build NavBar Using navBuilder() function that executed by foreach loop and other helping methods like createMenuLink() to create elements and insert text to it and also appending.

 3. use isInViewport() method to identify which section is on the viewport to help the isActive() method to give a special class to the sectoin and button in the NavBar to be clearly viewed to the user that this is the actual section he selected.

 4. Toggle the Navbar Visibility according to user interaction with a webpage by checking if he is scrolling or not using the setTimeOut Method.
