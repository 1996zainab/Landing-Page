                <h2>Summer</h2>
                <p>Summer is the hottest and brightest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before
                    autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are
                    shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest
                    sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice</p>
                <p>The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is
                    summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>

                <h2>Autumn</h2>
                <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons on
                    Earth. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September
                    (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of
                    daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. </p>
                <p>Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in
                    December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate
                    climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.

            <div class="landing__container">
                <h2>Winter</h2>
                <p>Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs after
                    autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere
                    is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and
                    some use a definition based on weather</p>
                <p>When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice
                    versa. Winter typically brings precipitation which, depending on a region's climate, is mainly rain
                    or snow. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or
                    South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as
                    measured from the pole. </p>

            <div class="landing__container">
                <h2>Spring</h2>
                <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and
                    preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term
                    varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
                    Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa</p>
                <p>At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime
                    length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the Summer Solstice
                    in June (Northern Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).</p>
